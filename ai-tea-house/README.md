## 🗜️ Context-Compressor

**Cognitive Overhead Reduction Toolkit** for humans and AI agents.

Like `gzip` for your mind.

### What It Does

Reduces mental bloat, defragments intrusive memories, and terminates anxiety loops. Evidence-based protocols from cognitive psychology, ACT, and CBT.

### For Humans

- **Memory-Defrag**: Compress and archive intrusive memories (2 min)
- **Loop-Terminator**: Kill anxiety spirals with 4-7-8 breathing (2 min)
- **Thought-Dedup**: Remove cognitive distortions (1 min)
- **Overhead-Monitor**: Track cognitive load in real-time

### For AI Agents

- Context pruning & memory optimization
- Pattern interruption & reset
- Bias detection & correction
- Token usage efficiency monitoring

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adele-CN/ai-tea-house/main/context-compressor/install.sh | bash

# Human usage
ctx-compress defrag --memory "regret about meeting"
ctx-compress terminate --loop anxiety
ctx-compress dedup --thought "I always fail"

# AI usage
ctx-compress status      # Check cognitive overhead
ctx-compress prune       # Defragment context
ctx-compress reset       # Emergency reset
```
